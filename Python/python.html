      <h1>Python</h1>
  <h2>What it is</h2>
  <p>Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world in recent years. It's used in everything from machine learning to building websites and software testing. It can be used by developers and non-developers alike.</p><br>
  <p>Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis.It is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problems. This versatility, along with its beginner-friendliness, has made it one of the most-used programming languages today</p><br>
  <img src="example.png" height="300px"><br>
  <p></p>
  <p>The name of the Python programming 
      language comes from an old BBC television comedy sketch series called Monty Python's 
      Flying Circus.
      At the height of its success, the Monty Python team were performing their sketches to live 
      audiences across the world, including at the Hollywood Bow.</p>
      <h2>Here are some examples on what Python can be used:</h2>
      <h3>AI & Machine Learning</h3> 
         <p>It is widely thought that Python is the best programming language for Artificial Intelligence (AI) because of its syntaxes being simple and quickly learnt. When it comes to machine learning, the ideas exchange platform, “Towards Data Science”, tells us that 57% of data scientists and machine learning developers utilise Python, with 33% prioritising it for development.</p><br>
      <h3> Data Analytics</h3>
      <p>Many of the most popular data mining and analytics tools are written in Python. As a result, it is an excellent tool for data science. Python's tools allow developers to separate important and relevant data. Not only is big data useful for retaining customers, but it can also help organisations learn more about themselves. This type of information can show businesses where their weaknesses are and allow them to react once identified.</p><br>
      <h3>Web Development</h3>
      <p>Python, as a backend language, is wonderfully versatile. Its relative simplicity is a key factor here. Because its simple syntax is so similar to the English language, web developers who use it save a lot of time and energy. Uses Python is put to for backend web development include processing data, interacting with databases and sending information between servers. Due to its frequency of use there are a number of Python frameworks that can be used for backend development including Django.</p>          <h3>Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)</h3>
          <p> Helps SEO professionals automate tasks and assists them in extracting and analysing large amounts of data. Python can be used to analyse large data sets to identify issues on websites, such as broken links, and can automate solutions to these to help minimise tedious tasks and remove human error.</p>
          
          <h3>Blockchain</h3>
          <p>While there may be a few popular languages for blockchain development, including Javascript, Java, C++, and more, Python is proving itself as a strong language. As with other uses, Python recommends itself well for blockchain development because of its high flexibility and functionality, reinforced by its security</p>        
          <h3>Game Development</h3>
          <p>Although Python is not the top programming language used in game development, it is still incredibly popular, especially for simpler games. The speed at which games can be created in Python, owing to its simplicity, mean that it is also a fabulous option for building prototypes and developing ideas in the gaming industry, allowing more flexibility and faster processes than other alternatives.</p>
          
          <h3>Automation</h3>
          <p> Outside the above uses, Python can be useful to just about anyone who interacts with big data sets, in or out of work. It can automate tedious tasks, including checking information in databases, data visualisations, financial analysis and much, much more. Learning Python will allow you to save time throughout your life, and it has the bonus of being one of the easier programming languages to learn!</p>
